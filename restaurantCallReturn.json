I also had their chili which was nice and spicy and super flavorful. I loved it. \n\nThe place also has really cool ambiance with various cowboy/country knock knacks on the walls everywhere."

I was told that my friends would not have wait in line when they arrived and could get right in if we tipped a hefty amount. Which we did and when my friends arrived they were turned away and told to go to the end of the line. I asked the gentleman to allow them in and he said he couldn’t because they were full. I asked for my money back and he, in a very disrespectful bullying tone told me that was his money. This guy has over 100 pounds on me and I didn’t want to fight with him and his goons at the door so I accepted what it was, A SCAM. We left shortly after that conversation and will never be returning again. I hope they feel good about themselves."

On Wednesdays, they have $2 gin and tonics and $2 hamburgers. Their non-happy hour prices were fairly high, but so are lost prices at downtown bars."
